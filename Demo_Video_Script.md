## INTRO (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Show the login page]**

> "Hello, I'm [Your Name], founder of Àpínlẹ̀rọ - an AI-powered business management platform designed specifically for ethnic grocery retailers in the UK.
>
> Today, I'll demonstrate how Àpínlẹ̀rọ transforms the way small ethnic grocery businesses manage their orders, customers, and inventory using artificial intelligence."

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Can show Isha's Treat WhatsApp screenshots if available, or stay on login]**

> "Ethnic grocery retailers like Isha's Treat currently manage orders through WhatsApp messages, paper notebooks, and spreadsheets. This leads to lost orders, missed customer opportunities, and significant food waste.
>
> Àpínlẹ̀rọ solves this with an intelligent, integrated platform."

---

## LOGIN & DASHBOARD OVERVIEW (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Login and show Overview tab]**

> "After logging in, shop owners see their command centre - real-time order stats, today's revenue, and an AI-generated daily summary that highlights what needs attention.
>
> Orders from WhatsApp, web, phone, and walk-ins are all unified in one place."

---

## FEATURE 1: AI INSIGHTS (30 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'AI Insights' tab]**

> "Our first innovation is the AI Insights Panel. The system analyses sales patterns and automatically generates actionable insights.
>
> For example, it detects that Palm Oil stock is running low before it runs out. It identifies that Tuesday sales are 40% higher than Monday - suggesting optimal restocking days.
>
> It even spots that customers buying Egusi often buy Stockfish together, revealing cross-selling opportunities no human would notice manually."

---

## FEATURE 2: WHATSAPP PROMOTIONS (30 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Promotions' tab]**

> "The WhatsApp Promotions feature is a game-changer. The AI identifies customer segments and suggests targeted campaigns.
>
> Here it's suggesting a 'Win-Back Campaign' for customers who haven't ordered in 30 days, with a personalised message ready to send.
>
> Shop owners can send promotions directly to customer WhatsApp with one ick - turning their existing WhatsApp workflow into a powerful marketing channel."

---

## FEATURE 3: CUSTOMER PREDICTION (30 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Customers' tab]**

> "The Customer Prediction engine uses AI to forecast when each customer will order next and what they're likely to buy.
>
> See here - Mrs. Adebayo typically orders every 14 days, and she's predicted to order Plantain and Egusi next Thursday.
>
> The system also flags at-risk customers who may be churning, allowing proactive outreach before they're lost."

---

## FEATURE 4: CULTURAL EVENT CALENDAR (25 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Calendar' tab]**

> "This is unique to ethnic grocery - our Cultural Event Calendar. The AI knows that Eid, Diwali, Nigerian Independence Day, and Christmas drive massive demand spikes.
>
> It automatically recommends which products to stock up on weeks in advance. For Eid, it suggests Rice, Lamb, and Dates. This prevents stockouts during the busiest cultural periods."

---

## FEATURE 5: SMART BUNDLES (20 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Bundles' tab]**

> "Smart Bundles uses AI to discover products frequently bought together.
>
> It's identified an 'Egusi Soup Starter' bundle and a 'Jollof Rice Kit' based on actual purchase patterns. Shop owners can activate these bundles with one ick to increase average order value."

---

## FEATURE 6: EXPIRY & WASTE PREDICTOR (25 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Expiry' tab]**

> "Food waste is a major issue for grocery retailers. Our Expiry Predictor tracks products approaching expiry and suggests actions.
>
> It might recommend a flash sale, a WhatsApp alert to regular buyers of that product, or bundling it with popular items. This reduces waste and recovers revenue that would otherwise be lost."

---

## FEATURE 7: CHANNEL ANALYTICS (20 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Channels' tab]**

> "The Channel Visualization shows performance across all order channels - WhatsApp, Web, Phone, and Walk-in.
>
> Shop owners can see that WhatsApp drives 60% of revenue, and that web orders have grown 25% this month. Data-driven decisions, not guesswork."

---

## FEATURE 8: DELIVERY OPTIMIZER (20 seconds)

**[Screen: ick on 'Delivery' tab]**

> "For shops offering delivery, our AI groups orders by postcode zone and optimizes routes.
>
> This reduces delivery time, saves fuel costs, and improves customer satisfaction. One-ick route optimization that would take hours to plan manually."

---

## FEATURE 9: ASK ÀPÍNLẸ̀RỌ (25 seconds)

**[Screen: ick the floating chat button in bottom-right corner]**

> "Finally, our natural language AI assistant - Ask Àpínlẹ̀rọ.
>
> Shop owners can simply ask: 'What sold best this week?' or 'Who are my top customers?' and get instant answers.
>
> No training needed. No complex reports. Just ask in plain English, and the AI responds with actionable data."

---

## OSING (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Return to Overview dashboard]**
