SUBJECT: 🔑 How to Get Your Stripe Keys
========================================

Hi Isha's Treat Team,

To enable payments on your Apinlero store, we need your Stripe API keys. Here's exactly how to get them:


📖 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
========================================

STEP 1: Log in to Stripe
-------------------------
Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com
(If you don't have an account yet, sign up at https://stripe.com)


STEP 2: Click "Developers" in the Left Menu
--------------------------------------------
You'll see a menu on the left side of your Stripe dashboard.
Click on "Developers"


STEP 3: Click "API keys" at the Top
------------------------------------
Once in Developers, you'll see tabs at the top.
Click "API keys"


STEP 4: Find Your Two Keys
---------------------------
You'll see two keys on this page:

1. Publishable key (starts with: pk_test_... or pk_live_...)
2. Secret key (starts with: sk_test_... or sk_live_...)


STEP 5: Reveal and Copy Each Key
---------------------------------
For EACH key:
1. Click the eye icon (👁️) to reveal the full key
2. Click "Copy" to copy it
3. Paste it into a document

Your keys should look like:
- Publishable Key: pk_test_51ABC123...
- Secret Key: sk_test_51XYZ789...


STEP 6: Send the Keys to Us
----------------------------
Once you have both keys, please send them to:

📧 ol.walexy@gmail.com

You can either:
✅ Create a Word document with both keys and email it
✅ Just paste both keys directly in the email

Format:
-------
Publishable Key: pk_test_[your key here]
Secret Key: sk_test_[your key here]


❓ COMMON QUESTIONS
========================================

Q: Will you have access to our money?
A: No! Payments go directly from customers to YOUR Stripe
   account to YOUR bank. We never touch your money.

Q: What's the difference between test and live keys?
A: - Test keys (pk_test_ and sk_test_): For testing with fake money
   - Live keys (pk_live_ and sk_live_): For real payments
   We recommend starting with test keys!

Q: How much does Stripe charge?
A: Stripe charges 1.4% + 20p per transaction in the UK.
   Apinlero doesn't take any additional fees.
