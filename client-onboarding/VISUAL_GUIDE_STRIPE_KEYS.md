## 📱 Step-by-Step Instructions

```
https://dashboard.stripe.com

Log in with your email and password.

### Step 2: Click "Developers" in the Sidebar

On the left side of the screen, you'll see a menu. Look for **"Developers"** and click it.

```

### Step 3: Click "API keys"

Once you're in the Developers section, you'll see a submenu at the top. Click on **"API keys"**.

```

                 ↑
           CLICK HERE!
```

### Step 4: Find Your Keys

You'll now see a page with your API keys. It looks like this:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Standard keys

⚙️ Publishable key
pk_test_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  👁️ [Copy]
                                       ↑
                               Click eye to reveal

🔐 Secret key
sk_test_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  👁️ [Copy]
                                       ↑
                               Click eye to reveal
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

### Step 5: Reveal and Copy Each Key

#### For the Publishable Key:

1. Click the **eye icon** (👁️) next to the Publishable key
2. The full key will appear (starts with `pk_test_...`)
3. Click the **"Copy"** button
4. Paste it somewhere safe and label it: **"Publishable Key"**

#### For the Secret Key:

1. Click the **eye icon** (👁️) next to the Secret key
2. The full key will appear (starts with `sk_test_...`)
3. Click the **"Copy"** button
4. Paste it somewhere safe and label it: **"Secret Key"**

### Step 6: Send Them to Apinlero

Now that you have both keys, send them to us securely:

**Option 1: Password-Protected Document**
1. Create a new document (Word, Pages, or TextEdit)
2. Type:
   ```
   Publishable Key: pk_test_[paste your key here]
   Secret Key: sk_test_[paste your key here]
   ```
3. Save the document with a password
4. Email the document to: **ol.walexy@gmail.com**
5. Send the password via WhatsApp: **[YOUR_PHONE]**

**Option 2: WhatsApp**
1. Open WhatsApp
2. Send both keys to: **[YOUR_PHONE]**
3. We'll delete the message immediately after saving them

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What These Keys Do:
- They allow your Apinlero store to accept payments
- Payments go directly to YOUR bank account
- We never have access to your money

### Keep Them Secret:
- ✅ DO share them with Apinlero (securely)
- ❌ DON'T post them online
- ❌ DON'T send them via regular unencrypted email if possible
- ❌ DON'T share them on social media

### Test vs Live:
- **Test keys** (`pk_test_...` and `sk_test_...`): For testing with fake money
- **Live keys** (`pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`): For real customer payments

We recommend starting with **test keys** first!

## 🤔 Don't See API Keys?

### If you see "Restricted keys" or "Custom keys" instead:

1. Scroll down on the API keys page
2. Look for the section labeled **"Standard keys"**
3. That's where your Publishable and Secret keys are

### If you don't have a Developers menu:

Your account might not have permission. Contact the account owner or:
1. Click on your profile (top right)
2. Click "Team & settings"
3. Make sure you have "Developer" or "Administrator" role
