## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What are these keys used for?
A: These keys allow your Apinlero store to process payments securely. When a customer buys from your store, the payment goes directly to YOUR Stripe account and YOUR bank account.

### Q: Will Apinlero have access to my money?
A: No! Payments go directly from your customers to YOUR Stripe account to YOUR bank account. We never touch your money. The keys just allow the payment process to work.

### Q: What's the difference between test and live keys?
A:
- **Test keys** (`pk_test_...` and `sk_test_...`): For testing payments without real money
- **Live keys** (`pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`): For accepting real customer payments

We recommend starting with test keys first, then switching to live keys when you're ready.

### Q: Are these keys safe to share with you?
A: Yes, but only if shared securely (as described above). We store them encrypted and only use them server-side to process payments on your behalf. We never expose them publicly.

### Q: Can I change these keys later?
A: Yes! You can regenerate new keys in your Stripe dashboard anytime and send us the new ones.

### Q: How much does Stripe charge?
A: Stripe typically charges 1.4% + 20p per transaction in the UK. You can see exact fees in your Stripe dashboard. We (Apinlero) don't take any additional payment processing fees.
