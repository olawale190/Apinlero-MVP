## 3. Cash Flow Analysis

### 3.1 Critical Point: Credits Are Not Cash Costs

| Cost Type | Cash Impact | Timing | Accounting Treatment |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Referral Credits** | No cash out | Applied to future invoices | Contra-revenue |
| **Social Share Credits** | No cash out | Applied to future invoices | Contra-revenue |
| **Testimonial Credits** | No cash out | Applied to future invoices | Contra-revenue |
| **Paid Advertising** | Cash out | Paid upfront | Marketing expense |

**This means:** Your £10,000 initial capital remains intact. Credits reduce future revenue, not current cash.

### 3.2 Year 1 Cash Flow (with Incentives)

|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|

## 11. Conclusion: Financial Viability with Incentives

### 11.1 Key Findings

1. **Incentive costs are manageable:** 5.3% of Year 1 revenue, declining to 3.2% by Year 3
2. **No cash impact:** Credits reduce future revenue, not current cash
3. **Strong ROI:** Referral program delivers 1,034% ROI
4. **Cash flow remains healthy:** Year-end cash balance of £49,330
5. **LTV:CAC still excellent:** 33:1 even with incentive costs included
6. **Break-even earlier:** Month 3 vs Month 5 (incentives accelerate growth)

### 11.2 Recommendation

**Proceed with the incentive program.** The £4,440 annual cost generates:
- 10 additional referrals worth £33,360 LTV
- 50+ pieces of social proof content
- Accelerated word-of-mouth growth
- Reduced dependency on paid advertising

**Net benefit:** £28,920 in Year 1 alone (LTV of referrals minus incentive cost).
