# PART E: INTERVIEW PREPARATION

## Common Questions & Your Answers

### 1. "Tell us about your business idea"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
Àpínlẹ̀rọ is an AI-powered operations platform that helps small
businesses manage orders from multiple channels - WhatsApp, phone,
walk-in, and web - all in one dashboard.

The problem: SMEs, especially in the African and Caribbean retail
sector, struggle with managing orders manually across different
channels. They lose sales, make errors, and have no visibility
into their business performance.

Our solution: A white-label platform that gives each business
their own branded online store, plus an intelligent dashboard
with AI-generated insights about their sales, top products,
and urgent actions.
```

### 2. "What makes this innovative?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
Three key innovations:

1. AI-Powered Insights: Unlike basic POS systems, we automatically
   generate daily business intelligence - showing owners their
   best-selling products, revenue trends, and urgent orders.

2. Multi-Channel Unification: No other affordable solution lets
   small businesses track WhatsApp, phone, walk-in, and web
   orders in one place.

3. White-Label Architecture: Each business gets their own branded
   storefront (like Isha's Treat), not a generic marketplace.
   This is enterprise-level capability at SME pricing.
```

### 3. "How do you know there's a market?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
There are 5.5 million SMEs in the UK. Our initial focus is on
African and Caribbean food retailers - a growing sector with
limited technology adoption.

We validated this through:
- Conversations with business owners about their pain points
- A live pilot with Isha's Treat & Groceries in London
- Research showing most small retailers still use paper or
  basic spreadsheets for order management
```

### 4. "What's your background and why are you suited to this?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
[Customize with your actual background]

- Technical skills: I built the entire MVP myself using modern
  technologies (React, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Business understanding: [Your relevant experience]
- Market knowledge: [Your connection to the target market]
- Entrepreneurial drive: [Previous ventures or initiatives]
```

### 5. "How will you make money?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
SaaS subscription model:

- Basic: £XX/month - Order management, basic dashboard
- Professional: £XX/month - AI insights, multi-channel tracking
- Enterprise: £XXX/month - Custom branding, advanced analytics

Additional revenue:
- Transaction fees (small % on online orders)
- Premium features (WhatsApp integration, inventory management)
```

### 6. "How will you scale and create jobs?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
Scaling strategy:
- Year 1: 10-20 pilot customers in London
- Year 2: 100+ customers, expand to other UK cities
- Year 3: 500+ customers, EU expansion

Job creation:
- Year 1: 1-2 (founder + developer/support)
- Year 2: 5-8 (sales, customer success, developers)
- Year 3: 15-20 (full team across functions)

The platform is built on cloud infrastructure that scales
automatically - one codebase can serve thousands of businesses.
```

### 7. "What's your proof that this works?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
We have a live MVP at https://apinlero.vercel.app

Current evidence:
- Fully functional customer storefront and owner dashboard
- Live pilot with Isha's Treat & Groceries
- Real orders being placed and managed
- AI insights generating automatically
- Mobile-responsive design

[Show screenshots or live demo if possible]
```

### 8. "What are the risks and how will you mitigate them?"

**Your Answer Framework:**
```
Key risks and mitigation:

1. Customer acquisition: Starting with referrals from pilot
   customer, targeting community networks

2. Competition: Focus on underserved market (African/Caribbean
   retail), build deep relationships

3. Technical challenges: Using proven technologies,
   cloud infrastructure for reliability

4. Funding: Bootstrap initially, seek investment after
   proving product-market fit with pilot customers

# PART H: QUICK REFERENCE - ELEVATOR PITCHES

## 30-Second Pitch:
```
Àpínlẹ̀rọ helps small businesses manage orders from WhatsApp,
phone, and web all in one dashboard, with AI that tells them
their best products and urgent actions. We're piloting with
Isha's Treat & Groceries in London.
```

## 2-Minute Pitch:
```
Every day, small business owners juggle orders from WhatsApp
messages, phone calls, walk-in customers, and maybe a website.
They use notebooks, spreadsheets, or just memory to track
everything. They lose orders, make mistakes, and have no idea
which products are actually making them money.

Àpínlẹ̀rọ solves this with a platform that unifies all these
channels into one smart dashboard. But we go further - our AI
analyzes their sales and tells them: "Your top product today
is Palm Oil, you have 3 urgent orders to confirm, and your
revenue is up 15% from last week."

We give each business their own branded online store - so
Isha's Treat & Groceries sees their name, not ours. This is
enterprise-level capability at a price small businesses can
afford.

We're live now with a pilot customer in London, and the
platform is ready to scale to thousands of businesses.
