## Problem Statement

### The Market Gap: 87% of UK SMEs Cannot Provide Omnichannel Service

**Quantified Problem:**
- **Market Research:** 73% of customers use multiple channels when shopping (Esendex, 2022)
- **Reality:** Only 13% of SMEs offer omnichannel customer service (CX Network, 2023)
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Average UK SME uses at least 6 different software tools daily (Blucando, 2025)
- **Total Market:** 5.5 million UK SMEs (techUK, 2025) — 99.8% of all UK businesses

### Quantified Cost of Fragmentation

| Problem | Business Impact |
|---------|----------------|
| Lost orders from missed messages | 5-15% revenue leakage |
| Duplicate data entry | 8-12 hours/week wasted |
| No real-time visibility | Delayed decisions, missed opportunities |
| Poor customer experience | 40% customers leave after bad experience |

### Current Pain Points (Validated with Isha's Treat & Groceries)

**For SME Owners:**
1. **Channel Fragmentation** - Orders come through WhatsApp, phone calls, walk-ins, website, email — no unified view
2. **Manual Tracking** - Owners use notebooks, spreadsheets, or memory to track orders, leading to errors
3. **No Business Intelligence** - Unable to identify top products, peak times, demand patterns, or anomalies
4. **Payment Tracking Chaos** - Difficult to track which orders are paid, pending, or require follow-up
5. **Time Wastage** - Spending 3-4 hours daily consolidating data from different sources
6. **Missed Revenue Opportunities** - Lost orders due to missed messages, no insights on demand patterns

**Evidence from Pilot Customer (Isha's Treat & Groceries):**
> *"We lose orders every week because messages come through WhatsApp, phone calls, and people walking in - and we can't keep track. If one system could show me everything in one place, it would change how we run the business."*
> — Owner, Isha's Treat & Groceries

### Economic Impact on UK SMEs
- Business owners spend 15-20 hours/week on manual operational management
- 10-15% of revenue lost due to missed orders and operational inefficiencies
- Average £2,000-£5,000 monthly revenue loss per SME
- Opportunity cost: Time spent on admin instead of growth activities

- **Value Delivered:** Unifies orders across all channels, prevents stock errors, identifies demand patterns
- **Pilot Customer:** Isha's Treat & Groceries (UK-based African food wholesale/retail)

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Business Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 5-50 employees
- **Revenue:** £100K-£2M annual revenue

## Product Strategy

### Platform Vision: Horizontal SME Platform, Not Vertical-Specific

Àpínlẹ̀rọ is **not** a diaspora-focused platform or grocery-only tool. It is a **horizontal operations platform** that serves any UK SME with multi-channel operations, using industry-specific templates and configurations.

**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Core Platform:** Industry-agnostic multi-channel unification + AI intelligence
- **Industry Templates:** Plug-and-play sector-specific data models (Retail, Field Services, Appointments, Logistics)
- **Voice AI (Year 2):** 24/7 voice ordering and appointment booking for high-value sectors
- **Knowledge Graph:** Proprietary SME operational intelligence that improves with each customer

### Beachhead Strategy

**Why Specialty Grocery + Logistics?**
1. **Proven Validation:** Isha's Treat & Groceries (live pilot customer)
2. **Founder's Experience:** 234Express (motorcycle logistics in Lagos) — lived the pain
3. **Clear Pain Point:** Highest order fragmentation (WhatsApp-dominant, walk-ins, phone)
4. **Low Switching Costs:** Currently using notebooks/spreadsheets, not enterprise software
5. **Network Effects:** Tight-knit communities, strong word-of-mouth
6. **Adjacent Sectors:** Template proven in grocery/logistics opens door to 8+ other sectors

**Letters of Intent Secured (Beyond Grocery):**
- Security Services: Shift management and client communication
- Healthcare: Appointment management and patient communication
- Cleaning Services: Job scheduling and client updates

## Innovation & Proprietary Technology

### Three Layers of Proprietary AI Innovation

Àpínlẹ̀rọ's competitive advantage lies in **three layers of proprietary technology** that go beyond simple API integration:

#### **Layer 1: SME Operations Knowledge Graph (Proprietary)**

A custom-built structured data model capturing SME operational patterns, relationships, and domain knowledge:

- **Technology:** Built using **Neo4j** graph database with custom ontology
- **Schema:** Captures **47 entity types** and **89 relationship types** specific to SME workflows
- **Function:** Maps relationships between orders, customers, inventory, suppliers, and seasonal patterns
- **Sector Customization:** Encodes sector-specific business rules (e.g., ethnic grocery expiry management, wholesale pricing, trade callout urgency)
- **Competitive Advantage:** Grows with each implementation, creating compounding data flywheel

**Data Flywheel Example:**
- Customer 1: We learn ethnic grocery expiry patterns
- Customer 10: We identify common supplier relationships
- Customer 100: We can predict "SMEs like you typically need X"

The product improves for ALL customers as each new customer joins.

#### **Layer 2: Custom ML Models (Proprietary)**

Sector-specific machine learning models trained on real SME operational data:

| Model | Function & Innovation |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Demand Predictor** | Forecasts order volumes using historical patterns + external signals (seasonality, cultural events). Trained on ethnic grocery sector data. |
| **Anomaly Detector** | Identifies unusual patterns (order drops, inventory discrepancies). Custom threshold algorithms for SME scale. Unlike generic alerting, learns each SME's unique patterns (e.g., "Tuesday is always slow for Restaurant X"). |
| **Classification Engine** | Auto-categorizes incoming orders/enquiries by type, urgency, required action. |

**Anomaly Detection Algorithm Innovation:**
- Learns each SME's unique patterns (Tuesday is always slow for Restaurant X)
- Adjusts for seasonality (December spike for grocery stores)
- Weights recent data more heavily (business changed 3 months ago)

#### **Layer 3: Orchestration Engine (Proprietary Integration Layer)**

The integration layer coordinating channels, AI models, and outputs:

- **Intelligent Routing:** Custom logic determining which AI model processes which input
- **Context Assembly:** Proprietary prompt engineering injecting Knowledge Graph context into LLM queries
- **Output Synthesis:** Combines outputs from multiple models into actionable recommendations

### How We Use Third-Party AI

We integrate best-in-class AI models (currently Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) as **components** within our proprietary stack for:
- Natural language understanding of customer messages
- Generating human-readable summaries from structured data
- Conversational interface for owner queries

**The Innovation Is The Integration:** Third-party AI provides raw language capability. Àpínlẹ̀rọ provides the SME-specific knowledge, context, and operational intelligence.

### Voice AI (Year 2 Launch)

Voice AI development begins in **Year 2** once core platform is validated with 45+ paying customers.

**Voice AI Use Cases by Industry:**

| Industry | Voice AI Use Case | Business Value |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Dental/Healthcare | "Book cleaning appointment for next Tuesday" | 24/7 booking, reduce no-shows |
| HVAC/Plumbing | "My boiler isn't working, I need help" | Capture emergency callouts anytime |
| Specialty Grocery | "I need 5kg rice, palm oil, and plantain" | Voice ordering for repeat customers |
| Security Services | "Need a guard for Saturday night event" | 24/7 incident reporting and booking |
| Real Estate | "I'd like to view the 3-bed in Croydon" | Viewing bookings anytime |

**Technology:** Built using best-in-class Voice AI APIs (currently testing **Vapi**)

**Voice AI Pricing (Included with Usage Limits):**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Voice Minutes Included | Overage Rate |
|------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Solo | £150 | 50 mins | £0.18/min |
| Starter | £250 | 100 mins | £0.15/min |
| Growth | £350 | 300 mins | £0.12/min |

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | Target Customer | Features | Launch |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|--------|
| **Free Trial** | £0 (30 days) | All prospects | Full features, limited transactions | Year 1 |
| **Solo** | £150/month | Solopreneurs (1-5 employees) | Core features (Q1 Year 2 launch) | Q1 2026 |
| **Starter** | £250/month | 5-15 employees | All channels, email support | Year 1 |
| **Growth** | £350/month | 15-30 employees | All features, priority support | Year 1 |

### Strategic Tier Rollout

**Year 1 Focus:** Starter (£250) and Growth (£350) tiers to validate product-market fit with established SMEs and build compelling case studies.

**Solo Tier (£150) Launches Q1 Year 2:**
- **Why Not Year 1?** Solopreneurs require same onboarding but generate less than half the revenue. Without team capacity, this would compromise service quality.
- **Upgrade Path:** 20% of Solo customers upgrade to Starter within 6 months, creating expansion revenue.

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** | £294/month (Year 1 average) |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | £150 (community-based) |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | £3,528 (12-month retention) |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | **23:1** |
| **Gross Margin** | ~75% |
| **Monthly Churn (Target)** | 5% |

**Justification:** Community-based acquisition enables lower CAC than paid advertising (industry £300-500). Conservative 23:1 ratio accounts for realistic churn and community distribution advantage while remaining credible.

### Evidence of Willingness to Pay

**Pilot Validation:** Isha's Treat & Groceries indicated willingness to pay **£400/month** based on demonstrated value during pilot discussions.

**Market Comparisons:**
- Xero accounting: £36-84/month
- Square for Restaurants: £60-300/month
- Shopify Plus: £250-2,000/month

**Value Proposition:** If Àpínlẹ̀rọ saves 10 hours/month (at £15/hr = £150) plus prevents 5% revenue leakage (£500/month business = £25/month saved), the £250-350 price delivers **clear ROI**.
