| **Employees** | 8 (3 full-time, 5 part-time) |
| **Revenue** | £350,000/year |
| **Tech Comfort** | Low-Medium (uses WhatsApp, basic smartphone) |

### Background Story

Adebayo opened his grocery store 7 years ago, serving the Nigerian and Caribbean community. Business has grown primarily through word-of-mouth and WhatsApp orders. He's drowning in WhatsApp messages, often missing orders or getting quantities wrong. His wife helps with accounting in Excel spreadsheets. He knows he needs to "get digital" but doesn't know where to start.

### Daily Challenges

|------|-----------|
| **6:00 AM** | Checking 50+ WhatsApp messages from overnight |

| **6:00 PM** | Trying to reconcile cash with paper records |
| **9:00 PM** | Still responding to WhatsApp order messages |

### Pain Points

- Grow online orders without losing personal touch

### Technology Usage

### Background Story

Sarah started her cleaning business 5 years ago after being made redundant. She's grown from solo cleaner to managing 15 staff serving 40+ regular clients. Growth has brought chaos - scheduling is a nightmare, she's constantly rescheduling due to sick staff, and tracking job completion is manual.

- **Trial Period:** Needs to prove reliability over 30 days
- **Support Preference:** Dedicated account manager preferred

### Quotes

> "If an officer's licence expires and they're on site, we could lose our ACS accreditation. It keeps me up at night."

> "When someone calls in sick at 5am, I'm calling through a list on my phone hoping someone answers."

### Àpínlẹ̀rọ Value Proposition

| Pain | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Compliance risk | Automated SIA/training expiry alerts (90/30/7 days) |
| Shift coverage | Officer availability system, auto-suggestions |
| Client reporting | One-click branded reports |
